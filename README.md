# Articles
A single repository containing my library of interesting and valuable articles, blogs, articles, books, other publications, tech talks and conferences from software engineering to management and leadership.
Please note these are all just external references, the repository itself is basically just collection of links.

Feel free to contribute, but please do so as it is suggested the [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) file. I would be happy to accept your links and extend this collection with other great materials :)

Please also note that the repository is new, so there's no much content available at the moment. As soon as I origanize my materials in a consumable way, and collect the related articles and blogs, I'll continously update it.
