# How can I extend the collection?

The preferred way is to do it yourself:
- Fork the repository
- Extend it with your own materials
- Submit a pull request so I can merge them

If you have issues with the process above it's also a viable solution if you drop me a line with your links to any of my contacts below:

For systematic contributors I'm happy to provide direct push access as well!
